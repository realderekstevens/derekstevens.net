# Oil on Pigeon Creek—A Iter's Journey. What we Saw and How we Saw It.

(From the Monongahela Republican.)

The oil fever has taken such fresh hold upon so many of our friends up the Creek, and such wonderful stories are daily brought down to town, that, anxious to develop their truth, we ordered a horse and buggy, and started for the theatre of excitement, on a prospecting tour early last Monday. Taking the Valley of Pigeon Creek, we first came to the old salt well at Vanvoorhis Mill. There we found Superintendent Caldwell and his assistants splashing up to the knees in a fine article of oil, worth 37c. per gallon. They say this oil is very good, and they could make a fair living at it, but Scott Appleton has raised the price of barrels and they can't afford to save it this year. We understand that Mr. Vanvoorhis offers to lease them ten acres of ground to raise pumpkins on; the seed was brought from California by Bud Williams, who says they will grow large enough to hold five barrels. It is intended to grow these enormous pumpkins, binding them with hickory poles and bracing them inside with oak saplings to keep them from warping or splitting.

At Blythe's we found William, Jim and John at work on their new basin. Eight feet from the surface they struck a vein of first quality Cincinnati lard, worth at the mine 14 cents a pound. They have taken out 22 barrels a day for four weeks; are satisfied; don't want to sell.

At Colvin's we found all well, and times prosperous. Twenty-two feet under the ground they struck a vein of wintergreen hair oil, which yielded well. They also found a few pockets of pomatum, and a thin vein of moustache cosmetic; not profitable to work, though some of the girls in the neighborhood have preserved some fine specimens of crystallized pomatum in quarts. Are short of barrels—a fine chance for a good cooper.

At Reed's Mill the principal find has been tallow. It is found at the depth of two thousand feet, mixed with mica, brown stone and white marble. The process of melting tallow is interesting, but we haven't time to describe it. There is generally about 73 per cent of pure tallow.

At Snyder's tanyard they are putting down a well which promises finely. A little suet is found occasionally in thin deposits, and some fine specimens of whale's blubber and red precipitate ointment have been discovered here.

H. Fry is working a fine vein of fresh butter. This valuable mineral is found in great quantities in combination with lard rock, dripping stone, and red hair granite; it is washed with a cradle and long tom, and in some instances worked with a quartz crusher and sluice stones.

At Leander Beazell's we found them busy in boring a well that gave better appearance than any one on the creek, and it was whispered around that the boys had surface indications of sausage meat, with strong hopes of a thick layer of Vandemark's Patent Fence. They don't want to sell.

At Witherow's blacksmith shop was a great crowd collected to hear Josiah Taylor tell about the progress of the well. 'Si had come there to get his horse shod, and said at six feet he had tapped a vein of croton oil as big as a gimlet; at thirteen feet he encountered a layer of soft soap; at fourteen feet he struck a vein of castor oil, discharging a barrel an hour; at fourteen and a half feet he found a valuable nugget of Wilson's pills, a small pocket of oil of cinnamon, and a crevice that yielded ninety hog-heads of pure spermaceti; and then at eighty-two feet depth they struck lard, by which they knew that butter was near; after cutting through six feet of solid leaf lard, they were rewarded by striking butter.

We put up for dinner at Asa Vanvoorhis', and he took us out to see a huge cave, on his farm, from the top of which hung, like icicles, millions of candles, six to the pound.

Dave Foumier has struck a splendid hole of apples, and is bringing them up with a sand pump, fifteen bushels by the hour; he soon hopes to reach the bottom, where there are indications of a first class article of crab cider.

We then came down to Simon Wilson's and up the hill to the Baptist Church, and then down towards Hiram Rabe's. Here we saw a soap grease bog, and the hill so slippery with the little rivulets of oil oozing out, that a man might turn back his coat tails, sit down, and slide down the hill two miles and a half, without friction enough to make his pantaloons need a patch.

Stepped in to see our good old friend Wm. Wickerham, who had struck a vein of fine castor oil, and the boys were out on the farm hunting for a tree that bore ready made glass bottles, with the corks in and gilt edged labels on.

We came on down the river, past Mr. Kernan's, who hallooed to us as we passed his house, that he had discovered the hill to be solid rock candy, and wanted to know if we would like to lease half an acre for one million dollars. Told him we hadn't the change with us.

So we jogged along home, and took down these imperfect notes from memory. We may have omitted some things, but not many.
