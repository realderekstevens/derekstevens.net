# Recruiting for the Army in Rochester

The Rochester Union, of April 5, says: "The recruiting party under the command of Lieut. Marshall, who lately occupied the premises No. 10 Mill street, have removed and are now located at No. 143 State street, in this city, where they have more spacious accommodations to suit their various military purposes and to entertain the numerous applicants who are daily soliciting admission into the army. Having visited the premises yesterday, we observed a most magnificent pole erected, from the top of which was suspended the stars and stripes, waving in all the majesty of national independence, and on entering the quarters we were kindly complimented with an inspection of the officers' books, containing a general record of all the enlistments and rejections since the 29th of March, 1860, (the date on which the office was established,) to the 28th of March, 1861, during which period 224 men have been enrolled into the Army, and 721 men rejected for various causes. Of those enlisted 196 were Americans, 55 Irishmen, 24 Germans, 18 Canadians, 10 Englishmen, 4 Scotchmen, 4 Swisslanders, 3 Frenchmen, and 2 Italians. The usual inducements are still offered to all suitable young men who are accepted by the recruiting officer and are so fortunate as to pass the surgeon's examination—pay from $11 to $22 per month, together with board, clothing, medical attendance, and the necessaries of life gratis. Upon inquiry we have been informed that men of the required qualifications are wanted immediately at the recruiting office, No. 143 State street, in this city."

☞The past winter has been one of unexampled severity. The snow has been two feet deep in the city of Jerusalem. Three houses were crushed by the weight of the snow. Eight inches of water fell in twenty-four hours. The Damascus road from Beirut was impassable for more than two weeks. On the 9th of February the passage of Lebanon was effected through the snow drifts three feet deep.

☞One of the last uses discovered for Iron is that of making it into collars and wristbands "as articles of clothing."

☞Gambling is said to be carried on to an extraordinary extent, just now, in Athens, Greece, where are there no less than 5,000 gaming houses.

☞There are said to be 100 men in Liverpool, England, who are each worth $5000.
